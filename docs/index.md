# Vitas: VUI Testing of VPA Apps

Vitas is a model-based framework to handle VUI testing of VPA apps. Vitas interacts with the app VUI, and during the testing process, it retrieves semantic information from voice feedbacks by natural language processing. It incrementally constructs the finite state machine (FSM) model of the app with a weighted exploration strategy guided by key factors such as the coverage of app functionality.
