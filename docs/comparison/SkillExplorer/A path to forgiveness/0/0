open forgiveness guide
E:
Hi there! I can teach you about the 9 steps of forgiveness, loosely based on research by the Stanford University Forgiveness Project. Just say continue to begin! If you've been here before, I'll try to pick up where we left off. If you want to start from a particular step, just say the word step, followed by the step number. You can say stop at any time to exit..
I:
stop
E:
Ok, Goodbye!.
