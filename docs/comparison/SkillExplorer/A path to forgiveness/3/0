E:
Hi there! I can teach you about the 9 steps of forgiveness, loosely based on research by the Stanford University Forgiveness Project. Just say continue to begin! If you've been here before, I'll try to pick up where we left off. If you want to start from a particular step, just say the word step, followed by the step number. You can say stop at any time to exit..

E:
Say next to proceed to the next step, or specify a step by saying step followed by a step number between 1 and 9. Follow the instructions and further prompts or say stop to exit at any time. And remember, baking is fun!.
