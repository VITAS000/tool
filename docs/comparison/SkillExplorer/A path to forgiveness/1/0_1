open forgiveness guide
E:
Hi there! I can teach you about the 9 steps of forgiveness, loosely based on research by the Stanford University Forgiveness Project. Just say continue to begin! If you've been here before, I'll try to pick up where we left off. If you want to start from a particular step, just say the word step, followed by the step number. You can say stop at any time to exit..

step seven
E:
Step 7. Move on. Instead of mentally replaying your hurt over and over, stop ruminating and seek out new friends and new situations that can lead to further positive influences. When you're ready for the next step, say continue, or say step and tell me the step number you'd like to hear..

E:
<---same content as before--->Step 8. Be the agent of change in your life. Remember that a life well lived is the best revenge. Instead of focusing on your wounded feelings, and thereby giving power to the person who hurt you, learn to look for the love, beauty and kindness around you.  When you're ready for the next step, say next..
