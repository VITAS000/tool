ask forty eight laws of power to quote one of the laws
E:
 Here's your law of Power: Law number 36.  Disdain Things you cannot have:  Ignoring them is the best Revenge By acknowledging a petty problem you give it existence and credibility.  The more attention you pay an enemy, the stronger you make him; and a small mistake is often made worse and more visible when you try to fix it.  It is sometimes best to leave things alone.  If there is something you want but cannot have, show contempt for it.  The less interest you reveal, the more superior you seem. .
