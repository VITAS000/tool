E:
 Backgammon is a game played between two opposing sides on a board marked with 24 triangles called “points”. Each side has 15 checkers of a different colour that move in opposite directions counting the points as spaces according to the numbers rolled by a pair of dice. The player first to get his checkers around, and then off the board, wins the game. In addition to their checkers, each player has a pair of dice and a dice cup, to shake and toss the dice. There is also a doubling cube which is initially placed in the middle of the tray on one side of the board. This cube is marked with the numbers 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 and 64 and is used for doubling the stakes in a game.  Which would you like to know: a backgammon tip or how to win? .

 To gain equality in the early part of a backgammon game you should do as much as you can to control the four-points and the five-points on your side and on your opponent's side. Never let your opponent take control of both these important strategic positions.  Which would you like to know: how to set up the game or what the rules are? .
