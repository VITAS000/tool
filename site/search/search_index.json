The table below shows the state space coverage of each technique. Here, the users' test results are for reference because they have no time limit. The last column is the union of state space coverage of three techniques and users. We carry out this experiment on the benchmark. The skills selected here satisfy three conditions: 1. They can be opened by four methods. 2. Their behavior is consistent for four methods. 3.
