Vitas interacts with the app VUI, and during the testing process, it retrieves semantic information from voice feedbacks by natural language processing. It incrementally constructs the finite state machine (FSM) model of the app with a weighted exploration strategy guided by key factors such as the coverage of app functionality. Download Vitas & Experiment See the VITAS directory for running VITAS. You can get the problems list of skills in the benchmark and large-scaled dataset. See the experiment directory for experiments.

The table below shows the state space coverage of each technique. Here, the users' test results are for reference because they have no time limit. The last column is the union of state space coverage of three techniques and users. We carry out this experiment on the benchmark. The skills selected here satisfy three conditions: 1. They can be opened by four methods. 2. Their behavior is consistent for four methods. 3. No network exception happens during the test.
