E:
&lt;Short audio&gt;.hmmm  the crying baby is awake already... I hope you're ready to play with her now!.&lt;Short audio&gt;. What cry do you want to listen to this time?  Her registry includes the  angry,  normal,  or  tired  cry.  For a full list, just say 'More info'..
I:
' more info'
E:
This game is pretty simple, you ask the crying baby for the type of cry you want to hear, and she performs it for you. At the moment, you can ask her for a: normal, tired, angry, bored, I want a cuddle, sleepy, starving, wait for it, grumpy,  or mega tantrum cry. Otherwise, you can ask baby for a random cry, and she'll choose any that you haven't listened to yet. Now, just ask baby for a cry and enjoy!.
I:
a normal
E:
&lt;Short audio&gt;. That was a good one, wasn't it?  For the next one, may I recommend the I want a cuddle,  or sleepy cry. Otherwise, the crying baby likes to do random cries. Just ask for it!.
I:
<---no answer--->
