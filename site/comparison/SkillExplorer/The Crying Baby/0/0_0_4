This game is pretty simple, you ask the crying baby for the type of cry you want to hear, and she performs it for you. At the moment, you can ask her for a: normal, tired, angry, bored, I want a cuddle, sleepy, starving, wait for it, grumpy,  or mega tantrum cry. Otherwise, you can ask baby for a random cry, and she'll choose any that you haven't listened to yet. Now, just ask baby for a cry and enjoy!.
