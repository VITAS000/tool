launch stanley's journey and tell me how stanley learns to navigate
E:
<---same content as before--->After such a terrifying episode, Stanley's parents decided he needed to learn about navigating the trail they used to resupply the people uphill. First they taught him that whenever they went out with the mule driver, he would take them along the stream until they reached the big wooden bridge. Stanley knew he could remember that, because of all the beautiful trout swimming in the stream. After crossing the bridge, they told Stanley to follow the trail until he got to the fork in the road where a big old pine tree shaded the trail. When he saw this pine tree, he needed to remember to stay on the side with the burn marks from the big fire. This was important to remember, because if he followed the trail on the other side, without the burn marks, he would end up going away from the stables. Stanley knew he would need to remember all of this, since he was going out with the Mule driver the next day. Want to hear more, asking me to tell you about the next day..
