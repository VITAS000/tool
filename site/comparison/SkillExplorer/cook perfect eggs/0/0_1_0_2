Fantastic.  Let's get started.   First things first. Place eggs straight from the fridge into an empty pot.  Then fill the pot with cold water so that the eggs are covered by one inch or two and a half centimeters of water.   Next, place the pot over a high heat to boil.  Once the pot is at a rolling boil with streams of bubbles coming from the bottom  remove from the heat and cover with a lid.  When you have removed the pot from the heat please tell me how you like your boiled eggs  and I can tell you how long to set your timer.   Do you like soft boiled with a runny yolk , medium boiled with a half set and half runny yolk , or hard boiled with a fully set yolk..
I:
a runny yolk
E:
sorry I didn't quite catch how you would like your boiled eggs.   Please say soft boiled eggs  or medium boiled eggs  or hard boiled eggs..
I:
hard boiled eggs
E:
fully cooked through and through.  Not a problem.  To achieve hard boiled eggs set a timer for eight minutes.  After eight minutes your eggs will be ready and hard boiled.  To make the peeling process easier  please transfer the eggs into some cold water. Gently peel the eggs  and serve up as you like. I recommend slicing the hard boiled eggs  and serving them on some buttered toast with avocado and a sprinkling of salt and pepper.  .
