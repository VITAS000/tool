<---same content as before--->So, you want to know about Stanley, right? Well, he's quite the character. He was born in the high sierra to a strong donkey daddy, and a beautiful mother. They loved him very much, but unforntunately he wasn't very good at keeping up with the other pack mules. One day, while the family was out hauling water up to the mountain, Stanley fell behind and got lost. His family tried to look for him, but the mule driver said they had to keep pushing. His family was distraught. Isn't that sad? Do you want to know what happened next? If so, ask me what happened next?.
