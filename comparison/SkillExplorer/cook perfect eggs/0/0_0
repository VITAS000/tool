You may think to yourself, why do I need Alexa to tell me how to scramble eggs.   It's easy throw some eggs in a bowl, mix and cook in a pan. Simple right? Well there are a few tricks to this deceptively simple dish that means the difference between scrambled eggs that are moist and creamy or scrambled eggs that are dense and rubbery.  Firstly combine four eggs, two tablespoons of heavy cream,  and a pinch of salt in a mixing bowl.   Be sure to gently mix the ingredients with a fork  so the whites and yolk have just combined. Ensure not to over whisk the mixture so that bubbles and a foam forms on top. coat the base of a non stick frypan with a melted knob of butter over a low medium heat.  You know the pan will be ready when the butter begins to sizzle.  Pour the egg mixture into the pan and let it settle in its own way.  Try not to disturb the mixture yet.  When the bottom layer of the mixture turns from translucent to opaque  the mixture is ready to be gently stirred with a rubber spatula. Try to gently bring the bottom layer to the top so that the uncooked top layer runs underneath the cooked parts.  When the uncooked parts just begin to look opaque and ready  remove from the heat and dish the egg out of the pan.   Even if the mixture doesn't look ready,  it will continue to cook with the residual heat.  And there you have it.  Perfectly cooked scambled eggs.     Try dressing it with some finely chopped chives and salt and pepper.   Bon apetite. .
