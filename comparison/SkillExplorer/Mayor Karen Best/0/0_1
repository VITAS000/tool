Greetings from Mayor Karen Best.  I can do several things to help you.  You can ask me things like, Tell me about the mayor.  What is Mayor Bests mission statement?  Where does Mayor Best stand on the issues?  Tell me about Public Safety.  Tell me about Infrastructure. Tell me about Economic Development. Why is the mayor running for re-election?  What is on the mayors to do list?   Or I can help you volunteer for the mayor or request Mayor Best at an event.  I know that is a lot, so if you need me to repat it, just say repeat, and then interrupt me with what you want to do.  Now, what can I do for you?.
