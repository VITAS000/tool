ask asthma device helper how to use advair diskus
E:
 Step 1. Open your ADVAIR DISKUS. Hold the DISKUS in your left hand and place the thumb of your right hand in the thumb grip. Push the thumb grip away from you as far as it will go until the mouthpiece shows and snaps into place. Step 2. Slide the lever until you hear it click. Hold the DISKUS in a level, flat position with the mouthpiece towards you. Slide the lever away from the mouthpiece as far as it will go until it clicks. The number on the counter will count down by 1. The DISKUS is now ready to use. Step 3. Inhale your medicine. Before you breathe in your dose from the DISKUS, breathe out as long as you can while you hold the DISKUS level and away from your mouth. Do not breathe into the mouthpiece. Put the mouthpiece to your lips. Breathe in quickly and deeply through the DISKUS. Do not breathe in through your nose. Remove the DISKUS from your mouth and hold your breath for about 10 seconds, or for as long as is comfortable for you. Breathe out slowly as long as you can. The DISKUS delivers your dose of medicine as a very fine powder that you may or may not taste or feel. Do not take an extra dose from the DISKUS even if you do not taste or feel the medicine. Step 4. Close the DISKUS. Place your thumb in the thumb grip and slide it back towards you as far as it will go. The DISKUS is now ready for you to take your next scheduled dose in about 12 hours. When you are ready to take your next dose, repeat Steps 1 through 4. Step 5. Rinse your mouth. Rinse your mouth with water after breathing in the medicine. Spit out the water. Do not swallow it. You have now completed using your advair diskus. What else can i help you with? .
